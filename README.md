# Miscellaneous Python Files
Grab bag of relatively small re-useable code Python snippets 

List of Files so far:
- File Count for Folders: Given a Main folder with several subfolders, prints the number of files within each subfolder in the terminal
- Character Cleaner: Given a column with unusual characters (non-alphanumeric and/or the standard English punctuation marks), will replace unwanted characters with a space and re-create original column
