# Miscellaneous Python Files
Grab bag of relatively small re-useable code Python snippets 

List of Files so far:
- ARFF2CSV: Converts all .arff files in folder to .csv files
- File Count for Folders: Given a Main folder with several subfolders, prints the number of files within each subfolder in the terminal
- Character Cleaner: Given a column with unusual characters (non-alphanumeric and/or the standard English punctuation marks), will replace unwanted characters with a space and re-create original column
- Find Cmap RGB Vals: Given a matplotlib cmap color scheme, identify the RBG values (not mine, found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33596491/extract-matplotlib-colormap-in-hex-format#:~:text=You%20can%20get%20a%20tuple%20of%20rgba%20values,wrote%20in%20the%20comments%2C%20you%20can%20use%20matplotlib.colors.rgb2hex.))
- Word Count: Given a file with a list of words, WordCount.py will consolidate into a .csv file with each word and the number of times it appeared in the original file
- Rename and Convert Images: Renames files and converts from png to jpg
